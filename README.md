## Go Go Cart
We plan on powering the cart with only one motor. This will be acomplish through gears. 
There will be a gear on the rear axel. There will also be a gear connnected to the motor.
The Gears will be perpendicular to eachother and will turn with eachother. 
There will also be a servo in the front that will turn the front wheels back and forth.

We havent updated any of the modeling yet but are still trying to get all the electrical components to work together. 
We got a demo to make the motor spin purely to make sure we could get it to work with the motor controller.
currently we are able to have the motor spinning and control the servo with the remote controll. our next step is to
get the motor to only spin if receiving comands from the remote and not constantly spinning.

The two channels of the remote controller is connected to the motor and the servo. The wheel controls the servo while the trigger controls the motor.
